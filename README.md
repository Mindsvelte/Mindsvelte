- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mindsvelte
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Github
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MySQL and PHP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on linking apps to share data across platforms.
  ie Stickynotes is fine on Microsoft systems but on my androids I've a plethora of stuff in Colornotes.

- 📫 How to reach me, I'm already getting too much spam and unrelated e-mails from the e-mail I've published on linkedIn and other ligit sites,
  so I'm not putting too many details out there right now. I don't use facebook and such.
